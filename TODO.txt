Additional TODO's:

Logistics:
-Create database teardown script? (so no duplicate records in db.stations on the next time runApp.sh is executed)
-Install a test suite and make some automated unit tests to run
-Smoke test of the whole system

Other possible issues to address:
-What about stations with geographic locations that are on the longitude line where 180 becomes -180?
